# Telegram Factbot
[Random Fact](https://t.me/ripoff_Factbot) is a bot I created as time pass. What the bot does is that it gives you a random fact when you type /start. It is basically a web scraper bot, it goes to a [Random facts site](https://factrepublic.com/), grabs a new random fact and sends it to your telegram.
 
## Setup:
If you want to create a telegram bot from scratch just watch [This video I made](https://youtu.be/mditeUism98). I have explained all the things you need to know to setup and code a telegram bot.

For the Documentation nerds I can point out some basic things.

- Go to telegram. Use [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Give new bot command, setup bot name and details. After that you will be given a token. This token is what you can access your bot with. Follow along my code to better understand how the code is developed.
- Next thing you need to do is setup a repl in Replit. There are telegram template, create one and remove the pre boilerplate code.
    
    Upload the main python file there. Now create a new file named keep_alive.py. Follow the code i have added a keep_alive import there. 
- Last thing to do is go to [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/), create a new bot, setup the repl link you have found in replit. The link should look like this:
    
    https://factcheck.fahim1368.repl.co

    NOT "replit.co", it has to be "repl.co"

    set up bot link, uptimerobot will keep the bot alive.
